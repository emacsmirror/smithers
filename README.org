Sometimes we all need is a raunchy message of encouragement from our employer.  This is a recreation of Waylon Smithers' [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xbyJGM1iUY][startup message]] from The Simpsons of Charles Montgomery Burns.

The audio is generated using [[http://espeak.sourceforge.net/][espeak]] phenomes, but it can speak with any audio (official or otherwise) that you feed it.

** Installation

   Install directly from MELPA or using =use-package=.

  #+begin_src elisp
    ;; Vanilla setup
    (use-package smithers)
  #+end_src

  Or

  #+begin_src elisp
    ;; Custom setup
    (use-package smithers
      :init
      ;; Adjust these to better
      ;; fit your window dimensions
      (setq smithers-autoscale nil
            smithers-leftpad 20
            smithers-scale -2.5
            smithers-fps 25))
  #+end_src

** Usage and Customization

   Run =smithers=, or =smithers-with-opts= to better tailor to your window dimensions.

   Espeak must be installed, and a media player that can play WAV files (=mpv= by default.)

   The following options below can be customized (the prefix =smithers= has been removed from the varname):

*** Scaling

  | VarName    | Default | Description                                                                                                              |
  |------------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | -autoscale |       t | Autoscale graphics by determining leftpad, toppad and scale values automatically. Disable to use the manual values below |
  | -leftpad   |     50 | Amount of manual left-padding to apply and better centre the graphics.                                                          |
  | -toppad    |       2 | Amount of manual top left-padding to apply and better vertical centre the graphics.                                                |
  | -scale     |    -3.5 | Amount to manually scale the ascii text. Negative values reduce the size.                                                         |


*** General    

  | VarName           |   Default | Description                                                                   |
  |-------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | -fps              |        25 | Frames per second to scale the duration intervals between each audio/graphic. |
  | -audiodelay       |         5 | Number of frames in which to delay rendering if media player is slow.         |
  | -activetext-limit |        50 | Maximum number of text items to render at any given time.                     |
  | -enddelay         |        50 | Number of frames to wait at the end of the animation.                         |
  | -mediaplaycomm    |     "mpv" | Media player command used to play WAVs.                                       |

*** Directories

  All ASCII graphics and words, as well as the sound WAVs are stored in the =elpa/smithers-data= root folder, with the relative subdirectories given below.

  | VarName           |   Default | Description                                                                   |
  |-------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | -dirascii         | "./ascii" | Directory where the ascii are kept.                                           |
  | -dirwavs          | "./wavs"  | Directory where the wavs are kept.                                            |
  | -dirwords         | "./words" | Directory where the wavs are kept.                                            |

  However if one wishes to change the audio or graphics sources, then one only needs to point to a new directory which contains a new set of (identically named) files.

*** Espeak

  The command to change the pitch (-p), speed (-s) and word gap (-g) for the espeak wav file can also be set by changing the variable, and by deleting all the WAVs in the =smithers-dirwavs= folder (which will force a regeneration).

  | VarName     | Default                                |
  |-------------+----------------------------------------|
  | -espeakcomm | "espeak -ven-us+m5 -p 80 -s 170 -g 10" |
