Sometimes we all need is a raunchy message of encouragement from our employer.  This is a recreation of Waylon Smithers' [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xbyJGM1iUY][startup message]] from The Simpsons of Charles Montgomery Burns.

The audio is generated using [[http://espeak.sourceforge.net/][espeak]] phenomes, but it can speak with any audio (official or otherwise) that you feed it.

** Installation

   Install directly from MELPA or using =use-package=.

  #+begin_src elisp
(use-package smithers
  :init
  ;; Adjust these to better
  ;; fit your window dimensions
  (setq smithers-leftpad 20
        smithers-scale -2.5
        smithers-fps 25))
  #+end_src

** Usage and Customization

   Run =smithers=, or =smithers-with-opts= to better tailor your window dimensions

   The following options below can be customized (the prefix =smithers= has been removed from the varname):

*** Espeak
